A simple boilerplate for your JS Sandbox needs.

Comes with Babel setup and two commands:

- **`start`** which, well, starts your code in `src/index.js` :)
- **`build`** which transpiles your fancy ES2017 syntax into the `lib` folder.

Oh, and my little library [galago](https://github.com/filipdanic/galago) (499bytes gzipped) is also included.

Just `git clone https://github.com/filipdanic/sandboxboilerplate.git` and hack away.
